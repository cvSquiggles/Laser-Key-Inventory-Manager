Goals:

- Clean up user input.

x Insure user input u_keyNum has a corresponding value in keyInventory table.

- Create resupply script.

- Create script that scans DB for all keys with an inventory count LOWER than the avg amount ordered in a month order by avg order size.

Bugs:

- If user input fails to convert to int, the program just runs the finally sequence as if nothing went wrong, but nothing happens. (tsql.py line 33, 34)
